This used to be:
xf86-video-wlshm - virtual/offscreen frame buffer driver for the Xorg X server

It is no longer.

Please, use the Xwayland server that is built from
	http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/
and was first released with xserver 1.16.


All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Wayland mailing list:
